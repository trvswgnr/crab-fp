# Technical Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for the crab-fp library, focusing on enhancing its functional programming capabilities while maintaining Rust's type safety and performance characteristics.

## Phase 1: Core Enhancements

### Typeclass System Improvements
- [ ] Add `Foldable` typeclass for container types that can be folded
- [ ] Add `Traversable` typeclass for types that can be traversed with effects
- [ ] Add `Monoid` typeclass for types that support associative binary operations
- [ ] Implement `Semigroup` as a prerequisite for `Monoid`
- [ ] Add `Alternative` typeclass for types that support choice operations

### Standard Type Implementations
- [ ] Add implementations for `HashMap` and `HashSet`
- [ ] Add implementations for `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`
- [ ] Add implementations for `Rc` and `Arc` smart pointers
- [ ] Add implementations for `Iterator` and custom iterator types
- [ ] Add implementations for `Future` and async types

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

### Error Handling
- [ ] Create a custom `Either` type with better ergonomics than `Result`
- [ ] Add `Validation` type for accumulating errors
- [ ] Implement `MonadError` typeclass for error handling
- [ ] Add utilities for error transformation and composition

### Effect System
- [ ] Design and implement a basic effect system
- [ ] Add `IO` monad for handling side effects
- [ ] Add `Reader` monad for dependency injection
- [ ] Add `State` monad for state management
- [ ] Add `Writer` monad for logging and accumulation

### Function Utilities
- [ ] Add point-free style utilities
- [ ] Implement function memoization
- [ ] Add pattern matching utilities
- [ ] Add more advanced currying options
- [ ] Add function lifting utilities

## Phase 3: Developer Experience

### Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for all typeclasses
- [ ] Create detailed examples for each major feature
- [ ] Add performance considerations and benchmarks
- [ ] Create a style guide for functional Rust
- [ ] Add migration guides from other FP libraries

### Testing
- [ ] Add property-based testing examples
- [ ] Create test utilities for functional code
- [ ] Add benchmarks for common operations
- [ ] Implement test helpers for monad laws
- [ ] Add examples of testing effectful code

### Tooling
- [ ] Create clippy lints for functional patterns
- [ ] Add IDE support for common operations
- [ ] Create code generation tools for boilerplate
- [ ] Add debugging utilities for monadic operations

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration

### Interoperability
- [ ] Add conversions from/to standard library types
- [ ] Create adapters for popular Rust libraries
- [ ] Add support for async/await patterns
- [ ] Implement serialization/deserialization support
- [ ] Add integration with popular web frameworks

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize common operations
- [ ] Add specialized implementations for common cases
- [ ] Implement zero-cost abstractions where possible
- [ ] Add compile-time optimizations
- [ ] Create performance guidelines

## Future Considerations

### Research Areas
- Investigate higher-kinded types implementation
- Explore dependent type system possibilities
- Research compile-time function composition
- Study effect system optimizations
- Explore type-level programming capabilities

### Community
- Create contribution guidelines
- Set up community channels
- Establish code of conduct
- Create issue and PR templates
- Set up automated workflows

## Notes
- Priority of features may change based on community feedback
- Some features may be moved between phases based on complexity
- New features may be added as the ecosystem evolves
- Performance considerations should be balanced with ergonomics
